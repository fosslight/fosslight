## Known Issue

### Issue1
- **Issue**: Recent FOSSLight scanner report file format, which includes TLSH and checksum data, cannot be uploaded to the BIN tab.
- **Reason**: The `TLSH` and `CHECK_SUM` columns are not included in the `OSS_COMPONENTS` table.
- **Workaround**: Manually add the following columns to the `OSS_COMPONENTS` table:
  - \`TLSH\`text DEFAULT NULL
  - \`CHECK_SUM\` text DEFAULT NULL


### Issue2
- **Issue**: User custom column in list view doesn't work 
- **Reason**: USER_COLUMNS table is not included in fosslight_create.sql
- **Note**: The table is already included in the migration script 20240401085317_update_2.0.0-beta.sql
- **Workaround**: Manually add the following  SQL script to fosslight_create.sql or create table in DB:
```
  CREATE TABLE `USER_COLUMNS` (
  `COLUMNS` longtext DEFAULT NULL,
  `LIST_TYPE` varchar(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `CREATED_DATE` datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
  `UPDATED_DATE` datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
  `USER_ID` varchar(45) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  PRIMARY KEY (`LIST_TYPE`,`USER_ID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```



### Fixed Version
 Above issues will be resolved in the official version 2.0.0.
