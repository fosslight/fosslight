## Notes
Hub version 2.0.0 is a major update that includes changes to the database schema.
We provide a migration script to upgrade to Hub version 2.0.0 for existing users.  
(Filename: 20240725150921_update_v2.0.0.sql)

This migration script involves several schema changes, so it is recommended to review the overall content.  
Please note that the migration script only supports normal cases.

The main changes and points to note are summarized as follows:

1. **Change of fk in OSS_LICENSE_DECLARED, OSS_LICENSE_DETECTED tables**
  - If there is invalid data in OSS_ID, an error may occur when changing the fk.
  - Therefore, it is necessary to check data integrity and perform correction work in advance if necessary.

2. **Deletion and modification of data in T2_CODE, T2_CODE_DTL**
  - The codes to be updated: 913, 230
  - Please check if you have been using these codes by modifying them.
  - This may affect related business logic or data references, so prior review is necessary.

3. **Schema change in LICENSE_NICKNAME table**
  - The schema has been changed to use LICENSE_ID.

4. **Separation of Opensource related databases**
  - Separated into 'OSS_COMMON' and 'OSS_VERSION'.

Before executing the migration script, please make sure to back up the database 
and run the script in a test environment to ensure there are no issues.
